# Jeanne_Practice

# Hey guys this is the api backend user guide**

# git clone "url" of this repo using ur terminal

# cd into the directory of the repo "Jeanne_Practice"

# run: code . to open the directory in VScode IDE

# in ur IDE Powershell terminal cd into the "api" file to install all the dependencies in it's Package.JSON

# run: "npm install" command to install all dependencies of the project

# after installation u will see that the main ".js" file is "server.js"

# now, you are ready to go

# you can either run: "npm start" to save yourself troubles of reruning "node server.js" everytime u need to start the server.
# or u can run: "node server.js" which is time consuming

# for the mac user, run: "yarn start" instead of npm
